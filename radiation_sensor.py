    Dronesmith API
    Mock Radiation Sensors

    This script requires the Python packages requests and geopy.
    pip install requests
    pip install geopy

    This script iterates through a JSON file of user account info and for
    each user it gets the current position of the user's drone, calculates
    radiation intensity using this position data, and then posts this
    intensity value to the drone. This process loops continuously until
    script is terminated.
